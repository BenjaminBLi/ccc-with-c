915C - program was too greedy: always took the equal, though it might be invalid
915B - poor implementation of accurate idea.
915E - didn't coordinate compress.
1409 - didn't find mid point between a and b
fhc15c1p2 - Coded trie wrong.
fhc15c1p2 - didn't free memory for trie properly.
1820 - Correct solution, incorrect math implementation - multiplying by two after dividing by k, not before. Results in truncation and thus WA
2066 - didn't consider any cases where a = 0 and b = 0 or anything that would make b*c = 0 
1910 - wrote the bounds wrong in my for loop
1910 - all 3 of the numbers in the interval don't need to be equal
1313 - copy pasted part of the terminal.
1225 - used int instead of long long
1225 - old recursive function counted extra - colours don't matter, and the problem is just a fib sequence.
ccc03s4 - reset didn't iterate through the full array in suffix array
ccc03s4 - tle due to bad implementation + mle due to bad memory freeing between cases. 
1581 - had an if block that god rid of last two numbers if cnt == 1
1585 - didn't handle newlines properly.
1263 - forgot `%` symbol
1100 - misread problem statement in terms of sorting
1100 - there is a difference between std::stable_sort and std::sort
1243 - misinterpreted problem, led to confusion with the modulus while calculating
1493 - forgot to comment out debug statements
1493 - didn't read statement properly - check for a guaranteed statement and not the actual answer
1110 - didn't read about the print -1.
1349 - forgot to get input
1607 - didn't properly handle two cases: would print wa if while loop doesn't calculate anything (4 3 6 1)
1636 - misread problem statement - didn't realize it was to check t1 vs t2 - penalty
1837 - didn't consider the case where Isenbaev wasn't present in input
1083 - assumed long longs weren't necessary + old code was needlessly complicated due to misunderstanding the formula
1654 - misread problem - stimulated too many steps
1654 - used inneficient way to print answer
1723 - printed wrong substring: only needed to print one character, any longer isn't guaranteed to be AC using my algo
2056 - didn't read the first part of the problem statement, missed a key rule
2002 - wrong placement of if statement, led to incorrect ouptut if during login, the name exists and was already logged in, but password was wrong
2035 - successive optimizations due to not knowing how bounds work.
1502 - used ints instead of long longs
1131 - didn't consider that n included the computer with the program on it.
1119 - didn't copy the first line of code.
2068 - copied the output words wrong.
2011 - greedy was incorrect - switched to a brute force.
1290 - formula was correct, but inaccurately implemented. multiple times.
1146 - was looping [0, n] instead of [l, n] in 2nd loop
1370 - printed all digits instead of n
1370 - rotate does weird stuff with memory, switched to for loop
1644 - didn't read problem statement closely. + was too lazy to test new code
1118 - proper divisor calculator was wrong and was too lazy to fix it.
1214 - wrote wrong condition, then tried to cheese.
1125 - bad bounds on a, used m instead of n
1126 - overcomplicated the problem, then implemented poorly multiple times
1226 - didn't print newlines.
1711 - first tried a naive greedy that would occasionally not find the answer, then implemented poorly
1336 - took me two submissions to realize I was printing wrong.
2102 - missed edge case where n is prime, then program was too slow
1688 - didn't read clearly: asked for > not >=
1402 - used wrong data type, needed long doubles instead of an integer type...
1982 - first tried a wrong naive algo, misread problem statement, then didn't use long long and/or init the dsu properly
1788 - n != m, was sorting by wrong size.
1167 - didn't handle bounds properly.
1931 - first had wrong order of numbers - didn't consider resetting people properly, and would also print wa if the first person was the best
1576 - didn't read a detail, then missed the word equal to 
1142 - n = 10 was wrong for some reason
1572 - max size of triangle is n, not n*sqrt(3)/2
1821 - misinterepreted question, then had wrong bound loops when checking for leaders, and then needed ll rather than ints
1709 - needed ll instead of int.
1017 - forgot to take off extra counted block
1135 - io was too optimized. trailing spaces existed where none should've
