915C - program was too greedy: always took the equal, though it might be invalid
915B - poor implementation of accurate idea.
915E - didn't coordinate compress.
1409 - didn't find mid point between a and b
fhc15c1p2 - Coded trie wrong.
fhc15c1p2 - didn't free memory for trie properly.
1820 - Correct solution, incorrect math implementation - multiplying by two after dividing by k, not before. Results in truncation and thus WA
2066 - didn't consider any cases where a = 0 and b = 0 or anything that would make b*c = 0 
1910 - wrote the bounds wrong in my for loop
1910 - all 3 of the numbers in the interval don't need to be equal
1313 - copy pasted part of the terminal.
1225 - used int instead of long long
1225 - old recursive function counted extra - colours don't matter, and the problem is just a fib sequence.
ccc03s4 - reset didn't iterate through the full array in suffix array
ccc03s4 - tle due to bad implementation + mle due to bad memory freeing between cases. 
1581 - had an if block that god rid of last two numbers if cnt == 1
1585 - didn't handle newlines properly.
1263 - forgot `%` symbol
1100 - misread problem statement in terms of sorting
1100 - there is a difference between std::stable_sort and std::sort
1243 - misinterpreted problem, led to confusion with the modulus while calculating
1493 - forgot to comment out debug statements
1493 - didn't read statement properly - check for a guaranteed statement and not the actual answer
1110 - didn't read about the print -1.
1349 - forgot to get input
1607 - didn't properly handle two cases: would print wa if while loop doesn't calculate anything (4 3 6 1)
1636 - misread problem statement - didn't realize it was to check t1 vs t2 - penalty
1837 - didn't consider the case where Isenbaev wasn't present in input
1083 - assumed long longs weren't necessary + old code was needlessly complicated due to misunderstanding the formula
1654 - misread problem - stimulated too many steps
1654 - used inneficient way to print answer
