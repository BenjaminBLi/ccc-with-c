915C - program was too greedy: always took the equal, though it might be invalid
915B - poor implementation of accurate idea.
915E - didn't coordinate compress.
1409 - didn't find mid point between a and b
fhc15c1p2 - Coded trie wrong.
fhc15c1p2 - didn't free memory for trie properly.
1820 - Correct solution, incorrect math implementation - multiplying by two after dividing by k, not before. Results in truncation and thus WA
2066 - didn't consider any cases where a = 0 and b = 0 or anything that would make b*c = 0 
1910 - wrote the bounds wrong in my for loop
1910 - all 3 of the numbers in the interval don't need to be equal
1313 - copy pasted part of the terminal.
