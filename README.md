Competitive programming repository, including solutions from various online judges, such as DMOJ, PEG, and UVa

Within the DMOJ folder, the problems are organized by problem code: each program name is taken from the url of the respective site - thus, to access the problem statement for a program, entering the url "https://dmoj.ca/problem/", and then the problem code should suffice.

If the problem does not exist, then the problem is taken from the WCIPEG website, and the problem can be easily found from their repository
